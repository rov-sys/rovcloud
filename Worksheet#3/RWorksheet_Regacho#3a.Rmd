Using Matrices
• Matrix can be created by specifying the rows and columns.
# row = 2
matrix(c(5,6,7,4,3,2,1,2,3,7,8,9),nrow = 2)
## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6]
## [1,] 5 7 3 1 3 8
## [2,] 6 4 2 2 7 9
# row = 3 and column = 2
matrix(data = c(3,4,5,6,7,8),3,2)
## [,1] [,2]
## [1,] 3 6
## [2,] 4 7
## [3,] 5 8



# creating a diagonal matrix where x value will always be 1
diag(1,nrow = 6,ncol = 5)
## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
## [1,] 1 0 0 0 0
## [2,] 0 1 0 0 0
## [3,] 0 0 1 0 0
## [4,] 0 0 0 1 0
## [5,] 0 0 0 0 1
## [6,] 0 0 0 0 0
diag(6)
## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6]
## [1,] 1 0 0 0 0 0
## [2,] 0 1 0 0 0 0
## [3,] 0 0 1 0 0 0
## [4,] 0 0 0 1 0 0
## [5,] 0 0 0 0 1 0
## [6,] 0 0 0 0 0 1

2. Create a matrix of one to eight and eleven to fourteen with four columns and three rows.

a. What will be the R code for the #2 question and its result?
```{r}
matrix_A <- matrix(c(1:8, 11:14), ncol = 4, nrow = 3)
matrix_A
```
b. Multiply the matrix by two. What is its R code and its result?
```{r}
matrix_B <- matrix_A * 2
matrix_B
```
c. What is the content of row 2? What is its R code?
```{r}
matrix_B[2,]
```


d. What will be the R code if you want to display the column 3 and column 4 in row 1 and row 2? What is its output?
```{r}
matrix_B[1:2, 3:4]
```
e. What is the R code is you want to display only the columns in 2 and 3, row 3? What is its output?
```{r}
matrix_B[3, 2:3]
```
f. What is the R code is you want to display only the columns 4? What is its output?
```{r}
matrix_B[,4]
```
g. Name the rows as isa, dalawa, tatlo and columns as uno, dos, tres, quatro
for the matrix that was created in b.‘. What is its R code and corresponding output?
```{r}
rownames(matrix_B) <- c("isa", "dalawa", "tatlo")
colnames(matrix_B) <- c("uno", "dos", "tres", "quatro")
matrix_B
```
h. From the original matrix you have created in a, reshape the matrix by assigning a new dimension with dim(). New dimensions should have 2 columns and 6 rows. What will be the R code and its output?
```{r}
dim(matrix_A) <- c(6,2)
matrix_A
```
Using Arrays
• Array can have more than two dimensions by using the array() function and dim()
to specify the dimensions



# creates a two-dimensional array containing numbers from 1 to 24 that have 3 rows and 4 columns
array_dta <- array(c(1:24), c(3,4,2))
array_dta

## , , 1
##
## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
## [1,] 1 4 7 10
## [2,] 2 5 8 11
## [3,] 3 6 9 12
##
## , , 2
##
## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
## [1,] 13 16 19 22
## [2,] 14 17 20 23
## [3,] 15 18 21 24
# checking for the dimensions
# row, column, dimension
dim(array_dta)

## [1] 3 4 2
#checking for the number of elements
length(array_dta)

## [1] 24

• Another way to create arrays
vectorA <- c(1:24)
# creating an array
an_Array <- array(vectorA, dim = c(3,4,2))
an_Array


## , , 1
##
## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
## [1,] 1 4 7 10
## [2,] 2 5 8 11
## [3,] 3 6 9 12
##
## , , 2
##
## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
## [1,] 13 16 19 22
## [2,] 14 17 20 23
## [3,] 15 18 21 24

3. An array contains 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 3, 4, 5, 1

a. Create an array for the above numeric values. Each values will be repeated twice. What will be the R code if you are to create a three-dimensional array with 4 columns and 2 rows. What will be its output?
```{r}
array_data <- array(rep(c(1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 3, 4, 5, 1),2),
dim = c(2,4,3))
array_data
```
b. How many dimensions do your array have?
```{r}
dim(array_data)
```
c. Name the rows as lowercase letters and columns as uppercase letters starting from the A. The array names should be “1st-Dimensional Array”, “2nd-Dimensional Array”, and “3rd-Dimensional Array”. What will be the R codes and its output?
```{r}
rownames(array_data) <- c("a","b")
colnames(array_data) <- c("A","B","C","D")
dimnames(array_data) <-list(c("a", "b"), c("A", "B", "C", "D"),c("1st-Dimensional Array","2nd-Dimensional Array","3rd-Dimensional Array"))
array_data
# It will display the same array but with named rows(a,b), columns (A-D) and dimensions (1st-Dimensional Array, etc.).
```
