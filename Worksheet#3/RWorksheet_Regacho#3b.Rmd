# STEP 1: Create the dataset manually ------------------------------

Respondents <- 1:20
Sex <- c(2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2)
FathersOccupation <- c(1,3,3,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,2,1,3,3,1,3,1,2,1)
PersonsAtHome <- c(5,7,3,8,5,9,6,7,8,4,7,5,4,7,8,8,3,11,7,6)
SiblingsAtSchool <- c(6,4,4,1,2,1,5,3,1,2,3,2,5,5,2,1,2,5,3,2)
TypesOfHouses <- c(1,2,3,1,1,3,3,1,2,3,2,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2)

# STEP 2: Combine into a Data Frame ------------------------------

household <- data.frame(
  Respondents,
  Sex,
  FathersOccupation,
  PersonsAtHome,
  SiblingsAtSchool,
  TypesOfHouses
)

# Display the initial data frame
household

# STEP 3: Replace numeric codes with descriptive labels -----------

household$Sex <- factor(household$Sex, labels = c("Male", "Female"))
household$FathersOccupation <- factor(household$FathersOccupation, labels = c("Farmer", "Driver", "Others"))
household$TypesOfHouses <- factor(household$TypesOfHouses, labels = c("Wood", "Semi-concrete", "Concrete"))

# Display the updated dataframe
household

# STEP 4: Save the dataset as a CSV file --------------------------

write.csv(household, "HouseholdData.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# STEP 5: View dataset and summary -------------------------------

print(household)
summary(household)

# STEP 6: Frequency table of Types of Houses ----------------------

table(household$TypesOfHouses)

# ================================================

# Figure 3: Sentiments of Tweets Per Day
# Interpretation:
# The bar graph displays the number of tweets classified as Negative, Neutral, and Positive
# for different dates. Based on the graph, Negative tweets appear most frequently,
# especially on July 15 and July 21, 2020, suggesting that many users expressed dissatisfaction
# or frustration on those days.
# Neutral tweets have moderate counts, showing balanced or factual content,
# while Positive tweets are fewer but still consistent throughout the dates.
# This indicates that public sentiment varies daily, with Negative tweets being the most dominant mood.
